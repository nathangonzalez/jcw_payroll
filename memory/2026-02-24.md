## Key Events
- **Health Plan Comparison:** Completed 3-way analysis (BCBS vs UHC vs Cigna/Nationwide) for 7 employees.
    - Result: Cigna saves $16k/yr but carries some admin risk (Level Funded). BCBS is the "safe" standard. UHC is most expensive.
    - Docs: `exports/health_plan_comparison_3_way.csv` and `exports/funding_comparison.md`.
- **Parallel Agents Strategy:** Shifted focus to "Parallel Agents" release.
    - Concept: Moving beyond a single Slack bot to multiple specialized agents (Story Generator, Research Digest, etc.) running in parallel, potentially via GitHub Actions or VM services.

## Decisions
- **Funding Model:** Explained Level Funded (self-insurance) vs Fully Insured to user.
- **Agent Architecture:** User explicitly requested "parallel agents". This implies unblocking the GitHub workflows (`deploy-slackbot.yml`, `research-digest.yml`, `story-generator.yml`) or setting up a supervisor process.

## Pending Actions
- **Agent Release:**
    - Review `../agent-ops/.github/workflows/*.yml` to ensure they are ready.
    - Check `STATUS.md` and `SPRINT_BOARD.md` for blocking tasks.
    - Execute deployment/activation.

## Notes
- `restore-latest-merge` is the critical endpoint for Payroll App stability.
- Slack bot needs `im:write` and `users:read` scopes fixed.
